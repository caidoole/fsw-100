            Welcome to Honey Light Wellness, a place where those seeking support can connect with those waiting to help.
            We all have moments in life were things are just a little more than we can carry alone.
            While there is no shame in asking for help, we recognize it is still the hardest thing in life to do.
            Be it pride or family pressure that created a barrier between you and the help you need, we offer you the
            anonymity to begin exploring your options.
        </p>
