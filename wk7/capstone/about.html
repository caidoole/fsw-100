        <p>
            Honey Light is based as an online community of people looking to help each other.
            We work with local companies to connect individuals and groups with the services they are looking for.
            Be it in-person or online, just you or your company, we strive to service everyone equally and fully.
            We work to fit into any schedule, location, and budget.

        </p>

        <p> In the last few years Honey Lights has made its mission to help people through all types of life events.
            There is no such thing as a small life event.
            We do not live by the line of "someone has it worse". Your difficulties in life still impact you and your
            family and should be taken seriously.
            We do believe in helping people as a whole and we have years of experience to back us up and help you
            through.
            Some of the more common reasons people seek out help from us include:

        <p>We work hard to create the foundations of trust needed to build a healthy realtionship with each company we
            connect you with.
            Everyone involved wants to see others living their best lives year after year. We do offer support in
            finding substance abuse clinics.
            We are a mandatory reporter of suspected abuse, and provide emergency services as needed to get individuals
            and children out of abusive homes.
