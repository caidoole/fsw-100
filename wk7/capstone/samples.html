        <p> Honey Lights helped me find a great support group after my husband died.
            They run a local group near my home and I am starting to feel like everything can be okay again.

        <p> My husband and I were having trouble after losing a much wanted pregnacy, everyone was so kind and
            caring.
            With so much information to shift through it could have easily been overwhelming, but they took the time to
            go over information at our pace.
            We were able to find a counselor and fertility doctor.

        <p>I run a small company and after a rough year I found morale was low. I didn't know where to go or who to turn
            to.
            A trusted friend referred me to Honey Light and they guided me to a wonderful comapany that worked with my
            staff to help us understand what was going on and bridge the gaps.

        <p>After college I moved across the country to follow my dream job.
            I found myself missing my friends, family and I felt like I was sinking.
            Honey Light helped me find a support group, making friends, also new to my area, helped me connect again.
            Thanks to them I can happily say I am still following my dreams with an even stronger support system than I
            ever thought possible.

        <h1>FAQ's</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>What exactly does Honey Light do?</li>
            <p> We work on a national scale to help connect people and companies in need with the services available that
                best suit them</p>
            <li>Why don't people just google search for servies?</li>
            <p> While that is a viable option for some, the amount of information out there can be overwhelming and it
                becomes increasingly difficult for them to find local information.
                Even after you find the help you are seeking it can seem like it just isn't the right fit. We facilitate
                a foundation connection that lets you get to know a company before you choose to work with them.
            </p>
            <li>Do you accept insurance?</li>
            <p> While we do connect some with health services, we do not actually provide any. This makes us ineligible
                to accept health insurance at this time.</p>
            <li>What is Contact Comforts?</li>
            <p>Contact Comfort is a purely platonic service provided by companies for those whose lives are lacking in
                touch.
                Touch is a vital aspect missing in millions of peoples lives, yet its essential for the health and
                happiness of individuals.
